## Why STAT 545

These lines pointed out by [Jennifer Bryan](https://github.com/jennybc) in the first day of [STAT 545](http://stat545.com/) provided enough motivation for me to take this course. 

> "in a wide array of academic fields, the **ability to effectively process data** 
> is superseding other more classical modes of research"

Apart from that, I wanted to learn R.

## How I edited my README.md

I used RStudio to:

1. Pull my assigned repo from github. 
2. Edit the README.md file locally.
3. Save and Commit the edited file.
4. Push the file to github.

## Documents to verify for Assignment 1

+ My main R Markdown document can be found [here](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/suresh-kumar_gokul-raj/blob/master/hw01_explore-gapminder.Rmd) 
+ The resultant Markdown document produced by knitting the above document can be found [here](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/suresh-kumar_gokul-raj/blob/master/hw01_explore-gapminder.md)

I felt that [Happy Git with R](http://happygitwithr.com/) provided a comprehensive explanation to get through the painful part. 

I played around with the examples provided in [Basic care and feeding of data in R](http://stat545.com/block006_care-feeding-data.html), and made minor modifications to it to produce my R markdown document.

The resources offered were sufficient enough for me to get past this hurdle.
